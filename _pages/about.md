## Who We Are
We are a student group project from the University of Hawaii At MƒÅnoa consisting of [Ryder Shintaku](https://github.com/rydershintaku), [Adam Winfield-Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamwinsmith/), and [Sam Doan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doansam/). Our Group is sponsored by [Mehdi Tarrit Mirakhorli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehdi-tarrit-mirakhorli/) and assisted by [Derek Garcia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derek-garcia/). 

## Background

Microsoft has an article writing about the [different nation-state threat actors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/unified-secops-platform/microsoft-threat-actor-naming) . We then use these naming conventions to better identify which nation-state threat actors have been the most acive because there have been an increasing number of malicous state actors, they are also known as Advanced Persistent Threats. So recently groups family groups like Typhoon (China), Sleet (North Korea), and Blizzard (Russia), and etc have been attacking the US Government. These APTs take advantage of legacy software, misconfigurations, and other software vulnerabilities to access protected systems.

## Our Goal

To combat this issue we developed a tool capable of scraping recent and relevant data from the internet and aggregating data related to common APTs and their activities. By collecting and analyzing this data, it can be passed to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate detailed intelligence reports. These reports would provide insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by these threat actors, enabling cybersecurity professionals to identify vulnerabilities, predict potential attack vectors, and implement defense strategies.
